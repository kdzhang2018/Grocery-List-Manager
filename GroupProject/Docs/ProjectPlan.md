# Project Plan - v2.0
**Author**: Team39

## 1 Introduction
This product will create Grocery List Manager, a simple Android application that can create and handle grocery lists.

## 2 Process Description
### Inception
This phase will focus on understanding requirements and identifying use cases. An architecture should be decided on. A design should be created that sufficiently addresses all of the project requirements. Any risks or assumptions should be included.
 - *Entrance criteria*: List of requirements from customer.
 - *Exit criteria*: Initial use case model that properly addresses requirement, architecture detailed in design document, and project plan (this document)

### Elaboration
This phase will focus on refining the design, architecture, and use case models for the application. The most challenging design areas will be addressed first, to validate that progress can continue to the lower difficulty areas. Time estimates will be made for each component, to make sure that the design is realistic in the time frame allotted. 
 - *Entrance criteria*: Requirement fully understood and realized in design documents. 
 - *Exit criteria*: Mostly done use case model. Any extra non-functional requirements not associated with a use case should be defined. Complete work on architecture. Test plan should be developed. Executable prototype. Initial user manual.

### Construction
This phase will focus on building a functional application. All of the features will be developed and tested. Writing on the user instructions should be fully fleshed out.
 - *Entrance criteria*: Agreement that the plan and design is complete and will work.
 - *Exit criteria*: All use cases should be implemented. A functional ‘beta’ version of app should be ready. Test Plan complete with some results. User manual completed.

### Transition
The final touches will be put on the program. Any final bugs or UI issues will be resolved and the product moved from a beta state to release. Users will provide feedback on any issues they find.
 - *Entrance criteria*: Working beta, ready for users to use/test.
 - *Exit criteria*: Final application with all design and user documentation. Test plan completed with full passing results.
